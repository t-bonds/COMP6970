Our office network starts with a standard modem connection to the internet. Between this modem and our router lies our 2 port iptables firewall. Our router than connects directly to our master network switch. A series of three sub switches are connected to the master switch, a switch for our web servers, a switch for our mail servers, and a switch for all other user devices on the network. There is no wifi through the network, as all servers and user devices will be wired connections (Mobile devices with cellular data will be allowed on premises for personal use). The three sub switches are only connected to the master switch and are not daisy chained with each other, so all traffic across switches must travel through the master switch. Out iptables firewall is configured so that no internet traffic will travel to/from our web server switch, except for select IP addresses directly connected to Cloudflare. NO FTP communication is allowed to/from the internet except from the Corporate IP netmask. Unsecure POP3 and SMTP ports have been blocked and will only be allowed through secure ports. SIP insecure ports have also been blocked, only allowing SIP traffic over TLS, for VoIP calls.
