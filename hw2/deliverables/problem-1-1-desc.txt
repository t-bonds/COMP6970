Our home network starts with a connection through a standard coaxial cable to a modem provided by our last-mile ISP. Between our modem and router is a Netgate SG 1100 firewall appliance with a pfsense firewall. As the firewall is linux-based, it will be configured with iptables. The iptables firewall will be configured to block all incoming "call-in" traffic, such as SSH, FTP, Telnet, RDP, etc. Our router will be using the OpenWrt Linux embedded systems OS. On our router will be SNORT, an Intrusion Prevention System that can be installed through OpenWrt. We are assuming our router contains sufficient processing power for this, as most modern routers now contain multi-core processors. Our router will also contain a firewall package installed through OpenWrt, operating under the same rules as the previous firewall, and will be protecting against intrusions already on the network. Each user on the network, when applicable, will also have firewall software running on their devices, though these end user devices will not contain the changed iptables from the modem and router, as Paranoid Pete will not allow configuration on his devices. Finally, we have set up ZPN, a free VPN service with a 10GBs / month limit, on Sally, Bob, and Alice's computers. Each user will have their own account, where they each get the 10GBs / month. Paranoid Pete will not allow us access to install ZPN, so it is up to him to decide if he will install ZPN or not.
